* **GET** http://localhost:8093/api/v1/dashboard/rest to get an object contained all authors and all books aggregated from corresponding services via **REST**
* **GET** http://localhost:8093/api/v1/dashboard/grpc to get an object contained all authors and all books aggregated from corresponding services via **GRPC**

  ####Body
  ```
    {
        "title": "New Book",
        "pages": 501,
        "authorId": 4,
        "firstName": "Omar",
        "lastName": "Khayyam"
    }
  ```
  in response, you'll receive a newly created Book.

Once a new book is added new event with BookAndAuthor info should be posted to the RabbitMQ queue.

Authors MS should consume an event, that contains the BookAndAuthor object, from the RabbitMQ and check if the author exists in the local storage (check AuthorService class). 
If the author is absent â€“ it should be added to the local storage.
